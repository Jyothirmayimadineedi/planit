Write a solution to find the character that has the highest number of occurrences within a certain string, ignoring case. If there is more than one character with equal highest occurrences, return the character that appeared first within the string.
<?php
// PHP program to output the maximum occurring character in a string
$ASCII_SIZE = 256;

function getMaxOccurringChar($str)
{
	global $ASCII_SIZE;
	
	// Create array to keep the count of individual characters and
	// initialize the array as 0
	$count = array_fill(0, $ASCII_SIZE, NULL);

	// Construct character count array from the input string.
	$len = strlen($str);
	$max = 0; // Initialize max count

	// Traversing through the string and maintaining the count of each character
	for ($i = 0; $i < ($len); $i++)
	{
		$count[ord($str[$i])]++;
		if ($max < $count[ord($str[$i])])
		{
			$max = $count[ord($str[$i])];
			$result = $str[$i];
		}
	}

	return $result;
}
?>

Build a food ordering system where the user inputs the food name into the food order and then the order getspassed to the appropriate restaurant on a list and the restaurant prints the receipt on stdout. No need to create a
UI, a main function that receives parameters is enough.
<?php
//database connection
mysql_connect("localhost","user name","password","database_name");
$menu_item=$_POST["menuitem"];
$sql_querry="select Menu_item,Restuarent_name,Price from restaurents where Menu_item=".$menu_item;
echo "you have selected".$sql_querry;
?>
